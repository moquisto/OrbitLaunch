# OrbitLaunch (Placeholder)

# IDEA -
Simulation for finding the trajectory to orbit that minimizes fuel consumption. Goal for the results - making a plot with the earth and a few starting positions that then shows the trajectory to orbit
with the trajectories color-coded according to fuel-consumption in that point in space - maybe add a sketch of this.

A few parameters will be tested once the model is made, things that can be varied that are also relevant to real-life application would be mass (payload size), cross-sectional area for atmospheric
resistance. Location will naturally be tested - can see how the earths rotation affects efficiency of launch location.

If we get this working we could start to consider how trajectories would look like for payload dropoffs. Launching a payload into orbit (for example a satellite) and for the booster rocket to reach
the ground again.
